# Web-Project

This is a web project carried out in the second year at CESI engineering school. This site is a fictional platform for searching for an internship within CESI. As a student, we can search for an internship and apply for it. As a training manager, we can create internship offers, as well as student accounts and company pages so that the student can consult the company in question.
